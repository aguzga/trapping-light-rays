            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In the context of the Computational Geometry course, we were asked to choose an open question related to
                the course material and for which we had to propose a concrete application in the form of a JavaScript program.  <br>  <br>
                The subject we chose for this project is the following : <b>Trapping Light Rays with Segment Mirrors. </b>
                </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Open question</h2>
            <p>
              The open question related to the above topic is the following:  <b> Is it possible to trap all the light
              from one point source by a finite collection of two-sided disjoint segment mirrors? </b> <br> <br>
              A light ray is trapped if it includes no point strictly exterior to the convex hull of the mirrors.
              The source point is disjoint from the mirrors. Although several versions of the problem are possible, it seems to make the most sense to treat the mirrors as open segments (i.e., not including their endpoints), but demand that they are disjoint as closed segments.
              </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Project idea</h2>
            <p>
              The main idea of the project is to realize an interactive javascript aplet that illustrates the problem,
              which will represent the programming part of the project. We will also study the reference research
              papers and present the current findings on this topic. Below, we give a preliminary image that illustrates the problem:
