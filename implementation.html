            <h2>User guide</h2>
            <p>
            We have implemented an applet that lets the user create disjoint mirrors between
            each two clicks within the visual limit. On top of that, the user can create rays that are sourced in the
            mouse position, by selecting the desired number of them through the respective slider. The creation
            of the dynamic rays happens only when the ”Shoot X-rays” button is clicked, which will shoot the
            selected number of rays equally separated by an angle such that they are shot all around the ray source.
            <br>
            <br>
            Additionally, we have implemented a mode in which the user can create a static ray in case it wants
            to shoot in a specific direction, as in the first mode the rays are arranged radially with equal angles
            from the source.
            </p>
            <h2>Algorithms</h2>
            <p>
            The central part of our implementation is without doubt the reflection of rays whenever they hit
            a mirror. Firstly, we had to find if a ray hits a mirror, and if it does so, what is the point in which it
            hits the mirror. Checking the intersection point for every mirror, we are able to find the nearest point
            that the ray should reflect from. As we have used p5.js Vectors to create the Rays, we are able to
            reflect the rays by using the reflect function of the p5js Vector class.
            <br>
            <br>
            An illustrative example of how the reflections work is given below, where you can observe 3 reflections. For each reflection, we have
            drawn the nearest intersection point, the direction of the reflected ray (blue arrow) and the normal to
            the mirror surface (pink arrow), which is particularly important when calling the reflect function.
