            <p>
              In their paper <i>Narrowing Light Rays with Mirros</i>, Joseph O’Rourke and Octavia Petrovici answer the
              question of whether it is possible to capture a ray of light with a set of curved mirrors ? The answer
              they give is yes, for both segment and curved mirrors. To do this, they simplified the problem by using
              a model where the rays coming from a source can be narrowed. To demonstrate this, in the case of
              segment mirrors, the authors make the following construction :
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class="center">
              <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aguzga/trapping-light-rays/main/img/segment_mirrors.PNG" alt="Segment Mirrors" width="400" height="400">
            </div>
            <p>
              In the case of curved mirrors, the authors use a necklace of disk construction to prove their hypothesis (see figure below).
            </p>
            <div class="center">
              <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aguzga/trapping-light-rays/main/img/circular_mirrors.PNG" alt="Circular Mirrors" height="400">
            </div>
            <p>
              Thus, O’Rourke and Petrovici state the following two theorems :
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><i>Given any &epsilon; > 0, the light emitted by a point source can be narrowed to rays whose angles differs
              by less than &epsilon; by placements of a finite number of disjoint segment mirrors.</i></li>
              <li><i>Given any &epsilon; > 0, the light emitted by a point source can be narrowed to rays whose angles differs
              by less than &epsilon; by placements of a finite number of disjoint mirrors disks.</i></li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              In addition, the authors point out the existence of different models of vertex-rays interactions. Among
              these models, the first is the round-vertex model, in which a ray striking a vertex (represented by a
              circular arc) bounces straight back, reversing its approach path. The second model mentioned by the
              authors is the butt-vertex. In this model, each vertex is cut off with a segment perpendicular to the
              angle bisector. When a ray hits a convex vertex in this model, it is reflected across the angle bisector.
              Finally, the last model cited is the split-ray model, in which a ray approaching a reflex apex of the
              middle inner cone splits into two rays, each one bouncing off the incident edges as if it were hitting those on the interior.

            <h4><b>Mitchell, Simon and Zhao</b></h4>
            <p>
              In their paper <i>Trapping light rays aperiodically with mirrors</i>, Mitchell, Simon and Zhao showed a
              mirror configuration in which a single ray of light is trapped aperiodically thus providing a negative
              solution to the O’Rourke and Petrovici conjecture. This conjecture was the following: the fact that
              mirrors cannot trap a light ray aperiodically would have implied that no mirror system could trap all
              the light coming from a point source. The construction put forward by the authors is the following :
              they placed six mirrors outside the open square, four horizontal and two vertical (see figure below),
              in such a way that a ray that leaves the central open square in one of these four directions necessarily
              returns to the same point in the square where it left.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
              <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aguzga/trapping-light-rays/main/img/mirror_config.PNG" alt="Mirror Configuration" height="200">
            </div>
            <p>
            Thus the three authors put forward two new theorems :
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><i>There is a mirror configuration in the plane that traps a light ray aperiodically.</i></li>
              <li><i>For any n ≥ 1, there is a mirror configuration in the plane that traps n distinct aperiodic rays
              from a single source.</i></li>
            </ol>

            <h4><b>Milovich Jr.</b></h4>
            <p>
            In his paper<i> Trapping light with mirrors</i>, David Milovich Jr. has shown that, given finitely many line-
            segment mirrors in the plane, that do not touch, and an arbitrary point source of light, if all angles
            made by lines parallel to mirrors are rational multiples of π, then all but countably many emitted
            light beams escape. This result implies that, for a given point source of light, a randomly chosen
            configuration of finitely many nontouching line-segment mirrors has a nonzero probability of letting
            at least one light beam escape. It seems important to note that, for simplification reasons, the author
            has chosen a mirror model for which the endpoints of the mirrors absorb all light beams. To reach
            the above conclusion, the author proves a series of theorems used as basic brick to provide a partial
            solution to the open problem posed by O’Rourke and Petrovici :
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li><i>Given two light beams with initial states 〈x1,v1〉and 〈x2,v2〉, if the light beams have equal, trapped hit sequences, then v1 = v2.</i></li>
              <li><i>For any two complex numbers x and x’, there are only countably many directions that allow a
              path from x to x’.</i></li>
              <li><i>Suppose the light beam with initial state 〈x0,v0〉 has a trapped periodic hit sequence; i.e., there is
              a positive integer P such that 〈μk(x0,v0)〉∞k=1 = 〈μk+ P(x0,v0)〉∞k=1. Then the light beam’s state
              is also periodic.</li>
              <li><i>Given an initial light-beam state, the set of legal configurations of n mirrors that allow the light
              beam to escape is an open subset of the set of all legal configurations; i.e., it is open in Mn.
              Moreover, given a finite sequence of mirror indices σ, let W denote let the set of legal configu-
              rations of n mirrors for which σ is initial segment of the light beam’s hit sequence. Then W is
              also open.</i></li>
              <li><i>Let N be a nonnegative integer and let 〈h0,p0〉 be an initial light beam state. Suppose that q0
              is not on any mirror or mirror endpoint, and that the light beam with initial state hq0, p0 hits
              mirrors at least N times before escaping of being absorbed. Then there is a neighborhood U of
              〈q0,p0〉 in C ×S1 such that, for every 〈q′0,p′0〉 in U, the light beams with initial states 〈q0,p0〉
              and 〈q′0,p′0〉 agree on the first N elements of their hit sequences. Also, let W denote the set of all
              light-beam states 〈q′0,p′0〉 such that 〈q′0,p′0〉 is not on the closure of a mirror, and the light beam
              with initial state 〈q′0,p′0〉 escapes after hitting mirrors exactly N times. Then W is open.</i></li>

            </ol>
